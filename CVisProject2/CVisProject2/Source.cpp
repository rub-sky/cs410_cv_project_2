---Face Detection and Recognition---
This project needs to develop a system that can automatically detect a face from an input 
image and recognize the face. A wide variety of algorithms and codes are available for 
face detection and recognition. You can use all the online code.

Grading policy:
a. Implement face detection. (10 points)
b. Test at least three different face recognition algorithms. (15 points for each algorithm)
c. In-class presentation (0-10 points)
d. Project report (0-20 points)
